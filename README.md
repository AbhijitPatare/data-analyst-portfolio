📊 Sales Analytics Portfolio — Data Analyst Case Study
Executive Snapshot

This project delivers a clean, insight-driven sales performance analysis built with a production mindset.
The objective is simple: turn raw transactional data into executive-ready business insights.

The notebook follows a real analyst workflow — from data quality validation to KPI construction, trend analysis, segmentation, and actionable findings.

Code is the engine. Insights are the product.
